We had a meeting regarding our project and discussed about the problem statement of our project.
The problem statement of our project is When we make an object or implementing some other functionality we sometimes load the unnecessary objects
In result the loading of unnecessary objects will occupy memory and also it will take time to create objects.
We also discussed an example regarding our problem statement. The example we discussed was customer and their orders.
when we are creating object for customer at that time we only need customers data not data about the orders class but unfortunately it was loading orders too
so we map that example with our problem statement. That's all we discussed in our meeting.
